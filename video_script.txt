2-3 Minute Video Walkthrough Script

Intro (0:00-0:10)
- Hello, I'm Yagneswari. This is my Companies Directory frontend assignment built using React and Tailwind CSS.

Overview (0:10-0:25)
- The application lists companies from a mock JSON and allows users to search, filter by location and industry, sort by name, and navigate with pagination.

Code walkthrough (0:25-1:00)
- Show project structure: src/components (CompanyCard, Filter, Pagination), src/pages/Home.js, public/data/companies.json.
- Explain key files: Home handles data fetch and pagination; Filter manages filters and sorting.

Demo (1:00-2:20)
- Show loading state (if simulating), search by typing 'Amazon' or 'Bangalore', choose a location, choose an industry, sort A-Z and Z-A, reset filters, and navigate pages.

Approach & decisions (2:20-2:40)
- Tailwind chosen for quick, responsive styling; axios for API calls; react-paginate for pagination.

Closing (2:40-3:00)
- Mention GitHub repo link and Netlify live demo link. Thank you.
